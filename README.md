## Getting Started

Before running the webserver, you need to install the dependencies:
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

To run the webserver:
`python3 run.py`

By default, the webserver will run on port 5001. If there is a port collision and you want to run it on a different port you can do `python3 run.py <port>`.

 E.g. if you want to run it on port 5050, the command would be `python3 run.py 5050`
